# CAT AND MOUSE

- Explanation  
The function catAndMouse(x, y, z) decides which cat will reach the mouse first. Here, x is the position of Cat A, y is the position of Cat B, and z is the position of the mouse. It finds the distance of each cat from the mouse. If Cat A is closer, it returns "Cat A". If Cat B is closer, it returns "Cat B". If both are the same distance, it returns "Mouse C", meaning the mouse gets away.
