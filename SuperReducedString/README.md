# SUPER REDUCED STRING

- Explanation  
This function removes matching pairs of letters that are next to each other. It goes through the string, and if two same letters are beside each other, they are deleted. In the end, if nothing is left, it returns "Empty String", otherwise it returns the reduced string.

- HOW TO TEST THE FUNCTION

- WRITE THIS IN THE CONSOLE  
console.log(superReducedString("aaabccddd")); // Output: "abd"  
console.log(superReducedString("aa")); // Output: "Empty String"  
Or try any characters to see the reduced result.
