# THE HURDLE RACE

- Explanation  
This function checks how many extra doses a character needs to jump the tallest hurdle. It finds the tallest hurdle, subtracts the characterâ€™s jump height, and if the result is positive, it returns that number. If the character can already jump it, it returns 0.

- HOW TO TEST THE FUNCTION

- WRITE THIS IN THE CONSOLE  
console.log(hurdleRace(4, [1, 6, 3, 5, 2])); // Output: 2  
console.log(hurdleRace(7, [2, 5, 4, 5, 2])); // Output: 0  
or input any jump height and hurdle heights
