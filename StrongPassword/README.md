# STRONG PASSWORD

- Explanation  
This function checks if a password is strong. It makes sure the password has at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. If something is missing or the length is less than 6, it returns how many characters need to be added.

- HOW TO TEST THE FUNCTION

- WRITE THIS IN THE CONSOLE  
console.log(minimumNumber(3, "Ab1"));    // Output: 3  
console.log(minimumNumber(11, "#HackerRank")); // Output: 1  
or test it with any password you want.
