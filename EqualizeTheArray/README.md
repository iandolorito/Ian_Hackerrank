# EQUALIZE THE ARRAY

- Explanation 
This function finds the minimum number of deletions needed so all elements in the array are the same. It counts how often each number appears, keeps the highest frequency, and subtracts it from the total length.

- HOW TO TEST THE FUNCTION

- WRITE THIS IN THE CONSOLE
console.log(equalizeArray([3, 3, 2, 1, 3])); // Output: 2  
console.log(equalizeArray([1, 2, 2, 3]));    // Output: 2  
Or test it with any array of numbers.
