# BIG SORTING
- Explanation
This function sorts very large numbers that are stored as strings.
It first compares their lengths, and if two numbers have the same length,
it compares them as normal strings.

- HOW TO TEST THE FUNCTION
- WRITE THIS IN THE CONSOLE
console.log(bigSorting(["1", "200", "150", "3"]));  
// Output: ["1", "3", "150", "200"]  
console.log(bigSorting(["31415926535897932384626433832795", "1", "3", "10"]));  
// Output: ["1", "3", "10", "31415926535897932384626433832795"]
