# SALES BY MATCH

- Explanation  
This function counts how many pairs of socks there are in a pile. It goes through the list of socks one by one and keeps track of how many of each color appear. Every time two socks of the same color are found, that makes one pair, and the pair counter goes up by one. At the end, the function returns the total number of pairs found.
