# SEQUENCE EQUATION

- Explanation 
This function solves the permutation equation. For each number i,
it finds where i is in the array, then finds where that position is in the array again.
The result is stored in a sequence and returned.

- HOW TO TEST THE FUNCTION

- WRITE THIS IN THE CONSOLE  
    console.log(permutationEquation([5, 2, 1, 3, 4])); // Output: [4, 2, 5, 1, 3]  
console.log(permutationEquation([2, 3, 1]));       // Output: [2, 3, 1]  
Or test it with any permutation array.
