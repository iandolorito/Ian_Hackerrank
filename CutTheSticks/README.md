# CUT THE STICKS

- Explanation  
This function cuts sticks down step by step. Each round, it records how many sticks are left, finds the shortest stick, and cuts that length from all sticks. It repeats until no sticks remain, then returns the results.

- HOW TO TEST THE FUNCTION

- WRITE THIS IN THE CONSOLE  
console.log(cutTheSticks([5, 1, 2, 3]));  
// Output: [4, 3, 2, 1]  

console.log(cutTheSticks([1, 2, 3]));     
// Output: [3, 2, 1]  
Or test it with any list of stick lengths.
