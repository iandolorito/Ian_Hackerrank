# ALTERNATING CHARACTERS

- Explanation 
This function counts how many deletions are needed so no two same letters are next to each other in a string. It goes through the string and adds 1 each time it finds a repeated letter.

- HOW TO TEST THE FUNCTION
- WRITE THIS IN THE CONSOLE
console.log(alternatingCharacters("AABAAB")); // Output: 2  
console.log(alternatingCharacters("AAAA"));   // Output: 3  
Or test it with any string of letters.
