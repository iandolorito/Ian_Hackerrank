# MIGRATORY BIRDS

- Explanation  
This function finds the most common bird type in an array of sightings.  
It counts how many times each bird type appears in the array.  
If two or more types have the same highest count, it picks the smallest type number.  
The function goes through the array, updates the count for each type, and keeps track of the highest count and the smallest type number with that count.  
At the end, it returns the smallest bird type number that was seen the most times.
